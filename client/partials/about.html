    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>My name is Jerrod Quintana, and this is my first serious project utilizing my MEAN skills, using MonogoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS, with a combination of CSS and Bootstap. I wanted to do a message board/forum and what better topic than video games, one of the things I'm most passionate about. You can view the entire website without being logged in but users are unable to do any kind of activity without being logged in.</p>
    <p>Users can register, log in, create topics, post on topics and comment on those posts, like posts or comments, and flag inappropriate activity. I utilized both client side and server side validations for all forms and security. You can also see all members, filter different tables, search for the different categories, see info about other users, edit your own profile, and give support or feedback. Admin users can also delete any topics, posts and comments, as well as view all support/feedback tickets. I know there is plenty that can be added onto this site but this is the basic functionality I wanted to implement before I work on my other projects. With any website, new functionality can be added, and problems/bugs can be addressed as need be.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a full stack developer and recent graduate of the Coding Dojo bootcamp. A 3 month intensive and immersive coding school that teaches you everything you need to know to be a full stack developer, from front end to the back end, database, deployment, github, common trends and practices, ect. Through Coding Dojo, I learned the Python track utilizing the python langauge and learning the MVC frameworks Flask, and Pylot, using MySQL database. I'm also currently in the process of learning the Django framework. I also learned the MEAN track utilizing the javascript language, MonogoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. And the last track I learned was Ruby on Rails, utilizing the ruby langauge, and Ruby on Rails MVC framework with both MySQLite and Postgres databases, using RSpec and Capybara for TDD or Test Driven Development. I've also learned front end languages such as HTML, CSS, Jquery, and the basics of Bootstrap. And lastly, i've learned other valuable skills for a programmer such as deployment, Github, working in a team/group, logic, and algorithms.
